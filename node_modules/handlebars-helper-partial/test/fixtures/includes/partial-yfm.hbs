title: This title is from the PARTIAL YFM (partial-yfm.hbs)
---
<article id="partial-yfm">
  <div class="title">
    {{title}}
  </div>
  <p class="description"> {{description}} </p>
</article>

In this example, the context for `title` should be from the YAML front matter of `partial-yfm.hbs`,
but since no `description` property exists in the YFM of the partial, the context for `description`
should come from the inheriting page.
