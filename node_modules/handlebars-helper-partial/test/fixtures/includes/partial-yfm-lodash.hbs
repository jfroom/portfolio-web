title: <%= site.title %>
description: <%= site.description %>

<article id="partial-yfm-lodash">
  <div class="title">
    {{title}} => {{site.title}}
  </div>
  <p class="description"> {{description}} </p>
  <p class="description"> {{site.description}} </p>
</article>

Note that the YAML front matter is "borrowing" data from the `site` object, which is defined in the Grunt config.

So in this example, `\{{title}}` will yield the same result as `\{{site.title}}`, and `\{{description}}` will
yield the same result as `\{{site.description}}`
