# assemble-contrib-contextual [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-contrib-contextual.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-contrib-contextual) 

> Generates a JSON file containing the context of each page. Basic plugin to help see what's happening in the build.

## Quickstart
In the command line, run:

```bash
npm install assemble-contrib-contextual --save
```

Next, to register the plugin with Assemble in your project's Gruntfile you can either specify the direct path to the plugin(s) (e.g. `./path/to/plugins/*.js`), or if installed via npm, make sure the plugin is in the `devDependencies` of your project.js package.json, and simply add the module's name to the `plugins` option:

```js
assemble: {
  options: {
    plugins: ['assemble-contrib-contextual', 'other/plugins/*.js']
  }
}
```

Once that's done, just add `assemble-contrib-contextual`, the name of this module, to the `plugins` option in the Assemble task:

Visit the [plugins docs](http://assemble.io/plugins/) for more info or for help getting started.



## Usage Examples

assemble: {
  options: {
    plugins: ['assemble-contrib-contextual', 'other/plugins/*.js'],
    contextual: {
      dest: 'tmp/'
    }
  }
}
```
